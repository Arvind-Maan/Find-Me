# Find Me

Find Me is a movie finder application that searches the MovieDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/) api and returns all results based on any given query.

The name was inspired by another generic project name that I choose for a movie recommendation system (https://www.github.com/arvind-maan/reco-me).

This project is intended to be the first of many in order to further my understanding of React and JavaScript.
